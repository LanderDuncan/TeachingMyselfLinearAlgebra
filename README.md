# Teaching Myself Linear Algebra

## Overview
In my experience, there is no better way to learn something than to try to teach it yourself. With that in mind, when I decided to learn linear algebra I decided to do so here, in a series of Jupyter notebooks, written from the perspective of me teaching someone else. Since this is an ongoing project, errors will be prevalent. Feel free to reach out if you notice anything in particular!

## Sourcing
The source for this content is Kahn Academy's course on Linear Algebra as well as other resources throughout the internet that supplemented my understanding.
