    "In order for V to be a subspace of R<sub>n</sub> V must:\n",
    "1. contain the zero vector.\n",
    "2. For all vectors x in v cx must also be in v. (Closure under scalar multiplication).\n",
    "3. For all vectors a and b in v the vector a+b must also be in v. (Closure under addition).\n",

    "##### A set containing only the zero vector is a subspace because:\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains the zero vector.<br>\n",
    "Any scalar multiplied by the zero vector is the zero vector.<br>\n",
    "The zero vector added to itself is the zero vector.\n",

    "##### A set containing the span of n vectors is a subspace because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero times each vector in the span equals the zero vector.<br>\n",
    "All vectors in the span are already multiplied by a constant so they are by definition closed under multiplication.<br>\n",
    "Any combination of vectors in the span will simplify down to adding the constants which means it is closed under addition.<br>\n",
