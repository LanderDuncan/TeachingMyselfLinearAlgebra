    "# Vector dot products\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector dot product is a scalar found by adding the product of each row of each vector together. For example, consider the two following vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "4\\\\\n",
    "6\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "5\\\\\n",
    "2\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product of these two vectors would be:\n",
    " $$4*5 + 6*2 = 32$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector dot products are commutative, in other words, the order of multiplication does not matter.\n",
    "#### Dot Product Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "# Vector Length\n",
    "The length of a vector is equal to the square root of all squared vector components:\n",
    "$$l = \\sqrt{a_1^2+a_2^2...a_n^2}$$\n",
